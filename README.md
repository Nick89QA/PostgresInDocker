# postgresDocker
Hi this is simple project where I was using only docker-compose.yml file, to up database postgres in docker. 
So if you want to deploy postgres locally without standart downloading database you will need:
1. docker desktop on your computer
To build docker container I used the command 'docker-compose up --build'
