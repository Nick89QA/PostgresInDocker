Project Description: Setting Up PostgreSQL Locally Using Docker Compose

This is a simple project that uses a docker-compose.yml file to set up a PostgreSQL database locally using Docker.
By following these steps, you can deploy PostgreSQL on your computer without the need for traditional database downloads.

Prerequisites:

Docker Desktop installed on your computer.
Deployment Steps:

Clone or download this project to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the project directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located.

Build the Docker container by running the following command:

shell
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This command will start the PostgreSQL container and build it if necessary.

PostgreSQL will now be running locally on your computer, and you can access it using your preferred database client or application.
